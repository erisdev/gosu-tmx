## WHAT IS THIS

Eventually, a usable TMX map loader that works with Gosu and doesn't care 
whether you're using Chingu or some home-grown game engine of your own
devising.

### WHY ON EARTH

I like Chingu and a TMX loader already exists for it, but it's just not the
right tool for what I want to do. Hopefully others will find this useful as
well. :)

### WHAT IS MISSING

Here's what's not: so far, map data is loaded and layers, object groups and
tile sets are created and the map is capable of drawing itself. Needs a better
way to cache the tile layout so it doesn't have to be rebuilt every time
something changes.

Validating the XML document to its DTD would be nice too, but I'll be buggered
if I can get Nokogiri to actually load the DTD. There is inadequate or no
documentation on this topic. Probably we'll just have mysterious failures on
unsupported or erroneous TMX files, which is not ideal.

Possible consideration for the future: move the dependency on Gosu into a
separate, mixable, matchable module. Maybe add explicit Chingu support too.
Handle tile set creation and drawing ops the same way we do object creation:
define a callback hook and let the user take care of it. Awesome.

Help is welcome, obviously.

## INSTALL

Don't do it yet. The API is so unstable it does not have a half life but a
quarter life.
